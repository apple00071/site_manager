## Quick Start

### 1. Database Setup

Run the SQL migration file in your Supabase SQL Editor:

4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy and paste the entire contents of `RUN_THIS_IN_SUPABASE.sql`
6. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)
7. Wait for "Success" message

This will create:
- âœ… 4 new database tables (project_updates, inventory_items, design_files, design_comments)
- âœ… All necessary indexes
- âœ… Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- âœ… Auto-update triggers

### 2. Storage Buckets Setup

Create 3 storage buckets in Supabase Dashboard:

#### Bucket 1: project-update-photos

2. Name: `project-update-photos`
3. **Toggle "Public bucket" to ON** âœ…
4. Click **Create bucket**
5. Click on the bucket â†’ **Policies** tab â†’ **New Policy**
6. Select **For full customization**
7. Policy name: `Allow authenticated uploads`
8. Target roles: `authenticated`
9. Check all: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
10. USING expression: `(bucket_id = 'project-update-photos'::text)`
11. WITH CHECK expression: `(bucket_id = 'project-update-photos'::text)`
12. Click **Save policy**

#### Bucket 2: inventory-bills
Repeat the same steps as above, but use `inventory-bills` as the bucket name.

#### Bucket 3: design-files
Repeat the same steps as above, but use `design-files` as the bucket name.

### 3. Install Dependencies

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "new row violates row-level security policy"

**Solution:** Make sure storage buckets are set to **Public** and have the correct policies.

### Error: "Failed to fetch updates/inventory/designs"

**Solution:** Run the SQL migration file (`RUN_THIS_IN_SUPABASE.sql`) to create the database tables.

### Error: "Module not found: @/lib/supabase-admin"

**Solution:** The correct file is `@/lib/supabaseAdmin` (camelCase). This has been fixed in the codebase.

### Build Errors

**Solution:** Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed, then `npm run build`.
