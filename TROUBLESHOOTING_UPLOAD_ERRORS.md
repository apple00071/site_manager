# Troubleshooting File Upload Errors

Based on the errors you're experiencing, here's a comprehensive guide to fix all upload issues.

## Error 1: "new row violates row-level security policy"

### What This Means
Supabase Storage buckets have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled, but the policies are not configured to allow authenticated users to upload files.

### Solution: Configure Storage Policies

You need to add storage policies for each bucket. Here's how:

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Visit https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Click **Storage** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Configure project-update-photos Bucket

1. Click on the `project-update-photos` bucket
2. Click the **Policies** tab
3. Click **New Policy**
4. Click **For full customization**
5. Fill in the form:
   - **Policy name**: `Allow authenticated users to upload`
   - **Allowed operation**: Check ALL boxes (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - **Target roles**: Select `authenticated`
   - **Policy definition - USING expression**:
     ```sql
     true
     ```
   - **Policy definition - WITH CHECK expression**:
     ```sql
     true
     ```
6. Click **Review**
7. Click **Save policy**

### Step 3: Configure inventory-bills Bucket

Repeat Step 2 for the `inventory-bills` bucket with the same settings.

### Step 4: Configure design-files Bucket

Repeat Step 2 for the `design-files` bucket with the same settings.

## Error 2: "Bucket not found" or 400 Bad Request

### What This Means
The storage buckets don't exist yet.

### Solution: Create Storage Buckets

### Create project-update-photos Bucket
1. Go to **Storage** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **New bucket**
3. Bucket name: `project-update-photos`
4. **IMPORTANT**: Toggle **Public bucket** to ON (green switch)
5. Click **Create bucket**

### Create inventory-bills Bucket
1. Click **New bucket**
2. Bucket name: `inventory-bills`
3. **IMPORTANT**: Toggle **Public bucket** to ON
4. Click **Create bucket**

### Create design-files Bucket
1. Click **New bucket**
2. Bucket name: `design-files`
3. **IMPORTANT**: Toggle **Public bucket** to ON
4. Click **Create bucket**

After creating all buckets, go back to **Error 1** above and configure the policies.

## Error 3: "Failed to fetch updates/inventory/designs" (500 Internal Server Error)

### What This Means
The database tables don't exist yet. The migration hasn't been run.

### Solution: Run Database Migration

1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**
5. Open the file `RUN_THIS_IN_SUPABASE.sql` from your project
6. Copy the ENTIRE contents (all ~330 lines)
7. Paste into the SQL Editor
8. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)
9. Wait for "Success. No rows returned" message

### Verify Tables Were Created
1. Click **Table Editor** in the left sidebar
2. You should see these new tables:
   - `project_updates`
   - `inventory_items`
   - `design_files`
   - `design_comments`

If you don't see them, the migration failed. Check the error message in the SQL Editor.

---

## Error 4: Column "can_view" or "can_edit" does not exist

### What This Means
The RLS policies in the migration file were using incorrect column names.

### Solution
This has been fixed in the `RUN_THIS_IN_SUPABASE.sql` file. The policies now correctly use:
- `(project_members.permissions->>'view')::boolean = true`
- `(project_members.permissions->>'edit')::boolean = true`

If you already ran the old migration, run the new one again. It will drop and recreate the policies.

## Quick Fix SQL Script

If you want to quickly set up storage policies via SQL instead of the UI, run this in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Storage policies for project-update-photos
INSERT INTO storage.policies (name, bucket_id, definition, check)
VALUES (
  'Allow authenticated users to upload',
  'project-update-photos',
  'true',
  'true'
) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

-- Storage policies for inventory-bills
INSERT INTO storage.policies (name, bucket_id, definition, check)
VALUES (
  'Allow authenticated users to upload',
  'inventory-bills',
  'true',
  'true'
) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

-- Storage policies for design-files
INSERT INTO storage.policies (name, bucket_id, definition, check)
VALUES (
  'Allow authenticated users to upload',
  'design-files',
  'true',
  'true'
) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

**Note:** This assumes the buckets already exist. If they don't, create them via the UI first.
